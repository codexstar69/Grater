 6. Miscellaneous Conditions 

-  Stacking Policy : Determine if users can apply multiple coupons on a single order.
-  Refund & Cancellation : If an order with a coupon applied gets canceled, determine the policy on whether the coupon gets reinstated.
-  Fallback : If a coupon fails to apply, give the user a proper error message, e.g., "This coupon is not applicable for selected items".

 7. External Factors 

-  Partnerships : If you partner with local businesses or events, you might offer special coupons for their patrons.
-  Festival or Season Special : Offer discounts during certain festivals or seasons.
