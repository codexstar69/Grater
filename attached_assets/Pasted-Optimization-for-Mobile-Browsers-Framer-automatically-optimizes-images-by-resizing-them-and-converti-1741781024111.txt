We’ve also considered user feedback from community forums to understand practical applications.

Detailed Findings
Performance Optimizations for Mobile Browsers
Framer applies several automatic optimizations to ensure websites perform well on mobile devices, addressing the limitations of smaller screens, lower processing power, and data constraints:

Image Optimization: Framer automatically resizes images and converts them to AVIF, a highly efficient format, to reduce load times. For example, a 3000×2000 px image uploaded for desktop is scaled down to fit mobile screens (512, 1024, 2048, 4096 pixels), ensuring minimal data usage (How images are optimized in Framer). This is crucial for mobile users with limited data plans.
Font Optimization: Framer optimizes font loading by preferring web fonts with weights from Light (300) to Bold (700), using font-display: swap to prevent text from disappearing during load. It also recommends Google Fonts for faster loading due to automatic subsetting, improving readability on mobile (How fonts are optimized in Framer).
Video Optimization: Videos are lazy loaded, meaning they only load when close to the viewport, and “GIF-like” videos (muted, looping, auto-playing without controls) pause when out of view, reducing battery and data strain on mobile devices (How videos are optimized in Framer).
Site Optimization: Framer pre-renders pages and minimizes main-thread work, ensuring fast initial load times. This is particularly important for mobile, where users expect quick access (Optimizing your site for speed and performance).
These optimizations collectively ensure that Framer websites are fast and efficient on mobile browsers, addressing key performance metrics like Lighthouse scores, which users often check for mobile performance (Improve Mobile Performance | Framer).

Design for Mobile Friendliness
Framer’s design tools are built to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring mobile friendliness. This includes specific features for typography (font size) and layout (columns, rows, etc.):

Breakpoints and Responsive Design: Framer uses breakpoints to define how the website behaves at different screen widths, such as Desktop (L), Tablet (M), and Mobile (S). Designers can adjust layouts, font sizes, and other properties for each breakpoint, ensuring the site adapts to mobile screens (Creating responsive designs). For example, a desktop layout with multiple columns might switch to a single-column layout on mobile for better readability.
Typography and Font Size: Framer allows setting text styles with breakpoints, enabling designers to customize font sizes for mobile. For instance, a heading might be 48px on desktop but reduce to 24px on mobile for legibility (Using Text Styles). Additionally, the Fit Text feature scales text to fit its container, automatically adjusting size based on screen width, which is particularly useful for headers on mobile (Framer Academy: Lesson: Fit Text). This ensures text remains readable without manual resizing, an unexpected detail that enhances mobile usability.
Columns and Rows: Framer provides grids and stacks for layout management. Grids can be set to adjust the number of columns based on screen size, often reducing to one column on mobile for simplicity (Make Any Website Responsive — Framer Blog). Stacks, Framer’s equivalent of auto-layout, allow vertical or horizontal arrangements that adapt, ensuring elements like navigation menus stack vertically on mobile for easier tapping. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining usability on smaller screens.
Layout Adjustments: Designers can use position relative or stacks instead of absolute positioning, which can make scaling to different sizes harder. For example, ensuring everything is within a container with a stack enabled helps scale layouts smoothly across devices (How to Create a Responsive Website in Framer: A Comprehensive Guide).
